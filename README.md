This project involves fine-tuning a GPT-2 model to generate song lyrics using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Project Overview
Goal: Fine-tune a GPT-2 model on a dataset of song lyrics to generate new lyrics.

Dataset: A collection of song lyrics from various artists (e.g., Bieber, Drake).

Tasks:

Fine-tune GPT-2 using the lyrics dataset.

Generate new song lyrics based on a given prompt.
Install Dependencies

First, install the required packages. Run the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Dataset

Place your song lyrics text files (e.g., bieber.txt, drake.txt) in the archive/ folder.

Use the c.py script to combine all text files into one lyrics.txt file, located in the data/ folder:
python c.py

Fine-Tuning the Model
Use the train.py script to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the lyrics.txt dataset:
python train.py

Generate Song Lyrics
After training the model, use the generate.py script to generate new song lyrics based on a prompt:
python generate.py

Script Details
c.py: Combines individual song lyrics text files into one large dataset (lyrics.txt).
train.py: Fine-tunes the GPT-2 model on the dataset.
generate.py: Generates new lyrics using the trained GPT-2 model.

Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies:
transformers
datasets
torch

Install them by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
